-- A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
    It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
    It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

    A class in Java can contain:
   Fields
   Methods
   Constructors
   Blocks
   Nested class and interface

   Instance variable in Java
   A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable.
   Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created.
   That is why it is known as an instance variable.

   new keyword in Java
   The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory
-----------------------------------------------------
-- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
       Ways to achieve Abstraction
           There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

           1.Abstract class (0 to 100%)
           2. Interface (100% )

   An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
   It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
   It cannot be instantiated.
   It can have constructors and static methods also and even main() method.
   It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
----------------------------------------------
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. for security purpose.
final can be a variable, method, class, parameter.

final variabe:
-------------

1. If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
2. A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable or uninitialized final variable.
3. We can initialize blank final variable only in constructor.
4. A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable.
   It can be initialized only in static block.

final method:
-------------
1. final method cannot be overriden, but can be inherited.

final class:
------------
A class declared as final cannot be iherited by any subclass

final parameter:
---------------
cannot change the value of the parameter

Constructors cannot be declared as final , because by default, constructors are not inherited (only invoked using super keyword in subclass).
So no need to declare them as final


Example : Wrapper Classes like String,Integer,Float are declared final , no one can override these.

---------------------------------------------------
INNER CLASS

Java Inner class or Nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.

Advantage of java inner classes:
--------------------------------
1) Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.
2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.
3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

Difference between nested class and inner class in Java:
----------------------
Inner class is a part of nested class. Non-static nested classes are known as inner classes.

Types of Nested classes
---------------------
1. Non-static nested class (inner class)
    1. Member inner class
    2. Anonymous inner class
    3. Local inner class
2. Static nested class

MEMBER INNER CLASS
A non-static class that is created inside a class but outside a method is called member inner class.
----------
A static class created inside a class is called static nested class.
It can access only static members of the outer class inclding private.
Cannot access the non static members of the outer class
------------
A class i.e. created inside a method is called local inner class in java.
If you want to invoke the methods of local inner class, you must instantiate this class inside the method.
Rules:
1.  Local variable can't be private, public or protected.
2.  Local inner class cannot be invoked from outside the method.
3.  Local inner class cannot access non-final local variable till JDK 1.7.
    Since JDK 1.8, it is possible to access the non-final local variable in local inner class.
--------------
A class that have no name is known as anonymous inner class in java.
It should be used if you have to override method of class or interface.
Advantage: Instead of creating a separate child class to override the super class methods, we use anonymous inner class with no class name to override

Java Anonymous inner class can be created by two ways:
1. Class (may be abstract or concrete).
2. Interface

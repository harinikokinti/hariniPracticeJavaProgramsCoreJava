ConcurrentHashMap class
A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates.
This class obeys the same functional specification as Hashtable and includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of Hashtable.
 However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is not any support for locking
 the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This class is fully interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on its thread safety
 but not on its synchronization details.

-- Stream
A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. There are two kinds of Streams âˆ’
1. Byte Stream
Operates on Bytes(bits)
FileOutputStream : to create a file and write data into it.
FileInputStream : to read data from the file.
2. Character Stream
Operates on characters (16  bit unicode)
FileWriter class : to write bytes to a file
FileReader class : to read bytes from the file
3. Buffered Stream
Operates line by line
BufferedInputStream or BufferedReader :  to read lines from the file
BufferedOutputStream or PrintWriter :  to write lines to the file
Note: Internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but here the major difference
is that FileReader reads two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.

-- File Operations:
Create File
Get File Information
Write to a file
Read into a file
Delete a file


-- NIO Nonblocking I/O
It takes the data in buffer and reads as junks ... for faster performance
